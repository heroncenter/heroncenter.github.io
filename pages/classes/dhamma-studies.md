Gather together as a spiritual community and immerse yourself in the studies of philosophy, history and the practices of meditation. Each week we will begin with a meditation, breath practice or mindfulness based practice. Afterwards a Dhamma Study will be shared to support an open reflection and insight based group discussion.
