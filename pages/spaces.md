# The Wildlife Sanctuary in Westport
<br />

## Protecting our natural world is essential to our survival. Beyond that, it is the source for inspiration and beauty.
<br />
Since 2012, the Squillante Family Trust has bequeathed our mission with 22 acres in Westport MA. The land we work with is part of a magical Riparian Biome. These biomes are essential ecosystems that support clean air, water and provide protection from erosion and flooding. We have partnered with N.R.C.S. to implement a Forest Management Plan to enhance ecology, augment conservation practices, and do more to support our pollinators.

Education is an integral part of ensuring sustainability and wellness. Our Center provides free access to green space for passive recreation in addition to welcoming the public into our space for educational experiences.

We understand that time and space is integral to the creation and development of your artistic endeavors. Money is often a limiting factor to an artists vision. We aim to break down the fiscal barrier to enable the creation of art and/or facilitate a place for you to offer your practices.
