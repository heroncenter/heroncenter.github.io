As an educational center for the human spirit, our programming philosophy is based on the concept that there is no “one size fits all approach to wellness or learning.” Following in the footsteps of the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu, in adhering to the simple concept that, “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach him how to fish and you feed him for a lifetime”. We empower individuals by ensuring education is the principal thread within all that we weave.

We believe in multi-generational experiences and providing safe and inclusive spaces for learning.
