Are you a seeker, in need of balance or simply have questions about spirituality or a “life path”?  We help individuals connect with their own “life path” by examining the framework and ancient teachings of P.O.T.E.G.P., and together create a road map towards a more peaceful way of living.

If you have reached a crossroad and are seeking advice and or guidance on the next step to take, this special reading provides practical wisdom.  Sessions last 60-90 minutes, $75 per session
