Our Mindfulness & Creative Expression Programs are uniquely designed to meet the group or individual needs and goals of the people we serve!
Learn to feel good, creatively express, and expand your mind in our mindfulness programs. These programs instruct each person in practices that support wellness and empower the individual. Participants will experience breath techniques, journaling, sound, movement, creative prompts and more.
Live music and other creative artistic expressions may and can be included in program.
