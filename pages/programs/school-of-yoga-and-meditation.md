Students in good standing may take the course again (as many times as you like) free of any additional charge. The training modules continue to evolve each year from everyone who has participated and truly the learning that never ceases. We provide the training and knowledge. It is up to each student to integrate the knowledge and demonstrate they can apply the practices. We will do all that we can to help each student meet our standards for safe and ethical teaching.

### Evaluation & Certification:

Overview

The program encourages you to find your own voice based on your own direct experiences and the wisdom within to create a practice that is authentic for you. When you become a practitioner you become part of a tradition.  Students will study the ancient traditions of Sadhana through Yoga & Meditation, Pranayama,  Bodywork (experiential anatomy and creative approach to movement/alignment) and P.O.T.E.G.P. principles, philosophy and dhamma (universal lessons).  Sadhana approach is about discovering a daily spiritual practice that is unique to you and that will enable you to align with nature and awaken to your fullest potential. If you are genuinely open, all of Life can become your teacher. Life's obstacles & joys are all for your awakening.  Life is happening for you. Take part in our program and Awaken to You!
