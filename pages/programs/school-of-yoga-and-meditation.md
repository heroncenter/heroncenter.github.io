## School of Yoga & Meditation 

### Awaken to You; Discover The Nature of who you are. 
“Know Thyself” is the first principle inscribed on the temple of Apollo at Delphi.
Denial of Self is a root cause of human suffering. Our school of yoga and meditation yokes philosophy and
movement in a comprehensive way that supports each persons journey in their unfoldment of awareness
to the multi-faceted Is-ness of who they truly are.
- **Education**, the principle thread within all we weave.
- **Empowerment**, integration of knowledge in a practical way for your everyday.
- **Inspirit**, activating the courage to live the life of your dreams

The Heron Center offers a introductory Yoga & Meditation Teacher Training and Certification Program. This experiential and theoretical course is designed to prepare each student on safe and ethical practices in yoga and meditation. You will be introduced to ancient traditions, concepts and tools that lead to embodiment of wisdom, balance, contentment, and everlasting peace. This program continuously evolves, just as change is a constant force that asks us to adapt by expanding upon or shed what is already known or believed. 

The philosophy of the program is rooted in the belief that you are both physical(3d) and non physical (non-3d). The most advanced scientific discoveries and theories known to us, at this point, suggest that there are at least 11 dimensions to explain all the observable effects in the Universe. So if there are at least 11 dimensions in the Universe there are at least 11 dimensions in everything that exists within the Universe, including you!  Part of Yoga is to bring unity and awareness to this fact of both physical and nonphysical realities, so you can awaken to all aspects of self, nurture the wisdom within and live in balance with Nature. 

The program encourages you to find your own voice based on your own direct experiences and the wisdom within to create a practice that is authentic for you. When you become a practitioner you become part of a tradition.  Students will study the tradition of Sadhana through Yoga & Meditation, Pranayama,  Bodywork (experiential anatomy and creative approach to movement/alignment) and P.O.T.E.G.P. principles, philosophy and dhamma (universal lessons).  The Sadhana approach is about discovering a daily spiritual practice that is unique to you and that will enable you to align with nature and awaken to your fullest potential. If you are genuinely open, all of Life can become your teacher. Life’s obstacles & joys are all for your awakening. Join our program, Awaken to You and discover that life is happening for you! 

One should note that P.O.T.E.G.P. adheres to teaching through models appropriate for one’s current stage of awareness. P.O.T.E.G.P. uses the concept of teaching “models” to signify the point that we are not trying to teach “Divine” or “Complete” truths/concepts. Models are used as tools to help one make progress within its limits(boundaries). This is based on the wisdom that Divine truths cannot be found within the limited use of human words.
