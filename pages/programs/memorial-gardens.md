Love is a perennial. It is an ever-present, enduring part of us and our relationships with others. Even when it seems to pale and lie dormant for a time, love will spring alive and flourish with fresh growth. It will bloom anew and fill our souls with color and fragrance. Life and Death are part of a continuum, where cherished ones leave moments in our hearts and memories that know no mortal boundaries. A memorial garden in honor of a loved one who has died, is a physical embodiment of that love. Entwined with the beauty of nature it is a place to visit and be still, to offer solace to the soul of those left behind in grief. Dedicating a garden, a tree or a bench on which to sit and remember loved ones who have passed, sited amidst a sanctuary for wildlife and community, is a beautiful and peaceful way to create a lasting legacy that reflects our eternal love. 
If youâ€™d like to dedicate a personal Memorial Garden please contact us.
