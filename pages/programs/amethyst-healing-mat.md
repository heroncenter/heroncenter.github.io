Enjoy the healing energies of the mat within the tranquil atmosphere of our Treehouse Yurt.

90% of the mat is filled with Purple Amethyst which can produce negative ions for the body’s healing and cleansing process. The remaining 10% part in the head position is emitted by the other 4 types of gems including Yellow Agate, Obsidian, Turquoise, Obsidian, and Red Agate. Learn more about the healing benefits from the mat at the [PHYMAT website](https://www.phymatlife.com/collections/amethyst-heating-pad/products/violet-amethyst-infrared-heating-pad).
