This is a thoughtful and appropriate dance class that allows participants to cope with the physical, mental, and emotional effects of the aging body! This class offers a chance for instructors and participants to find joy within the community through movement and music.  The model of this class is inspired from the Dance for PD program, and is suitable for those in a chair or with movement limitations. Modifications are given within the class structure. Age is just a number, movement is essential to life, so come dance with us!
