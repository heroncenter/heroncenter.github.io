The Heron Center takes an active step towards increasing sustainability, ensuring equitable access to education, culture and health in our community!
Many of our programs, classes and events are offered tuition free or offered by donation (pay from the heart).

For our tuition based programs we offer a 50% discount to eligible members of our community as part of the *Card to Culture program.*

Eligibility for 50% discount:
We offer a 50% discount to Veterans, EBT, WIC, and ConnectorCare cardholders through the *Card to Culture* program.

You can reserve ahead and pay in person with QR code or cash/check at 50% off any of our tuition-based [programs](/programs/), [classes](/classes/), and [events](/events/). If you have any questions about how to attend our programs, classes, or events, do not hesitate to reach out to us.

*Mass Cultural Council’s Card to Culture program is a collaboration with the Department of Transitional Assistance, the Department of Public Health’s WIC Nutrition Program, and the Massachusetts Health Connector. See the complete list of participating organizations offering EBT, WIC, and ConnectorCare discounts.*
