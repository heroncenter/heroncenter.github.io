Harvest and Forage with joy, when dry and at your own risk. Open daily from dawn through dusk from May - September. Follow guidelines; only take ¼- ⅓ cuttings of any plant or grouping (leaving the rest for wildlife), Bring your own tools, Ask permission (plants are sentient and have feelings too). Do Not Dig Up Whole Plants
