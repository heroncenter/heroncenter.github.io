Support our Wildlife Sanctuary

Habitat Creation, Conservation & Education

Summary of Project: This project will improve the structure and composition of existing fields and wetland habitat on the Center’s 22 Acres in Westport MA, as a means to significantly enhance natural features to encourage aquatic and terrestrial wildlife and provide a year round, handicap accessible educational building. We have chosen 8 sites within our landscape mosaic that will be protected and cared for. In addition to supporting the habitat for wildlife, the site focuses on education for the public in providing talks, written literature and opportunities for people to learn about and interact with the wildlife with which we are privileged to share our space. We see education as an integral part of stewardship, sustainability and wellness.

Vision for our Space:

    Wildlife Habitats tailored towards species considered threatened, improving habitats, planting Native species and eradicating invasives.
    Informational and Interactive Signage to guide and educate. 
    Lean-to’s for meditation, wildlife viewing, nature retreats. We believe in offering space for people to not only connect with the natural world but the nature of one’s own self / mind. 
    Self Guided Meditation Tour with maps provided of meditation zones, each zone will include boxes of information that can aid or prompt one into a meditative experience.
    Farm Stand & Tea House for gathering and enjoying nature’s bounty.
    Year Round Handicap Accessible Educational Center for hosting an array of programs; providing seasonal residencies for volunteers and artists, and a space for community to gather and learn.
