Naming The Philosophy of the Eight Guided Paths Spiritual Guidance Center Charitable Trust as a beneficiary on your financial accounts—such as retirement plans, bank accounts, and life insurance policies— costs nothing and doesn’t require a will or lawyer.

You add us as a beneficiary the same way you would add a loved one—or you can add us in addition to loved ones. All you need to do is contact your account provider and request a “Change of Beneficiary” form (you might find this on the provider’s website).
