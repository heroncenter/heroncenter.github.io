Retirement funds in many ways are the perfect asset to leave to charity, because – unlike your heirs – charitable beneficiaries do not have to pay any income taxes for receiving those funds. It is also quick and easy: You simply need to notify the custodian of your retirement funds that you want all or part of a particular fund to pass to The Philosophy of the Eight Guided Paths Spiritual Guidance Center Charitable Trust.
