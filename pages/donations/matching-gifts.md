Many employers, whether you are currently employed or retired, offer to match donations that you make personally to your favorite charities. Simply ask your employer if this is an option at your workplace, and if so, they will provide you with instructions and a matching gift form. It’s a great way to double your gift, and help The Heron Center take actions towards sustainability, wellness and creativity in our community and for our world.
