The simplest and most common way to include The Philosophy of the Eight Guided Paths Spiritual Guidance Center Charitable Trust (D.B.A. The Heron Center) in estate planning is by making a charitable provision in your will or trust. This kind of charitable bequest can be a designated dollar amount, a percentage of your estate, or the residual amount remaining in your estate after all other obligations have been made.</p>

You and your attorney may use this sample language:

```
“I herby give and bequeath ______ (dollar amount, or percentage, of residual of the estate) to the The Philosophy of the Eight Guided Paths Spiritual Guidance Center Charitable Trust, 179 Legacy Lane, Westport, MA 02790, for its general purposes.”</i>
