# Classes

Learn to feel good from attending weekly wellness classes that instruct each student in practices that support balance, wellness and cultivate peaceful living. 

The Heron Center takes an active step towards increasing sustainability, ensuring equitable access to education, culture and health in our community! Our educational experiences are based on the philosophy that there is no “one size fits all” approach to wellness. The more you develop awareness of Self, the more you sense freedom and ease of being. Each experience within our space is as unique as the person offering it. Each class aspires to empower the individual with knowledge for safe and sustainable practices that will last a lifetime.

We believe in multi-generational experiences, safe and inclusive spaces for learning.
