Celebrate the natural cycles of change in our environment as well as within ourselves. 
In New England, the year naturally unfolds through 8 major seasonal shifts, each with their own symbolism and carrying with them unique traditions.


Take part in timeless traditions.

Our cultural and seasonal events give time to pause, reflect, gather as a community, mark the changes occurring around and within, while providing a gentle rhythm to how we experience the year with the ones we love. All of our seasonal celebrations welcome the whole family to participate and our inclusive to all peoples.
