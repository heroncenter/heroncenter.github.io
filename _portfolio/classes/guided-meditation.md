This practice invites meditators to share space and take advantage of the positive force of like minded peoples joining together for a guided meditation practice. Each session you may experience different meditations from different traditions that support relaxation and increase one’s powers of concentration. No one sitting is the same! Learn to deepen your practice, understand the mechanics behind meditation and discover ways to be the change you’d like to see in the world. 

Experience Level: All Levels Meditation (Youth and Adults welcome); no experience needed to attend. This practice teaches meditation as a tool for self awareness and healing.
