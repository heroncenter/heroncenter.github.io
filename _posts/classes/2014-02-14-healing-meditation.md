This is a healing service meditation experience. Practitioners are invited to join together with the intention of opening themselves up to be a vessel for healing energies and prayers. Each sitting will offer an attunement, a way of setting up for the meditation and grounding into the intention of the practice. 20-30 minutes of the practice will be in silence. This allows for each practitioner to move into their own soul’s awareness. 

Know that your experience during the “sitting in services” is your own. You may be guided to state prayers out loud or silently inward. Certain people or places may come to mind. You may notice temperature changes, hear or see in the mind’s eye. Trust that nothing needs to happen, you could simply sit and just be as you are while anchoring to the intention of healing and know that you are doing this right. We recommend journaling after each experience.

Experience Level: All Levels Meditation (Youth and Adults welcome); no experience needed to attend. This practice teaches meditation as a tool for self awareness and healing.
